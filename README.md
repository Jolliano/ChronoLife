# ChronoLife
ChronoLife Tracker is an elegant, responsive web application that visualizes the passage of time through interactive progress bars. This intuitive tool tracks day, month, and year progression while offering a unique life expectancy calculator to reflect on your personal timeline.

The application features real-time updates showing exactly how much of each time period has elapsed and what remains, presented through visually appealing progress bars with detailed statistics. The life calculator component allows users to input their birthdate and life expectancy to see a percentage-based representation of their life journey.

Built with HTML5, CSS3, and vanilla JavaScript, this project demonstrates clean frontend development with a cohesive color scheme, smooth animations, and full responsiveness. The interface includes social sharing capabilities and maintains accurate time calculations with automatic leap year adjustments.

Perfect for productivity enthusiasts, developers seeking inspiration, or anyone contemplating time management, ChronoLife Tracker offers both practical utility and philosophical reflection on our most precious resource: time.
